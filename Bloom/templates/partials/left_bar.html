                        Our platform makes this incredibly simple, by providing a search tool for events at school, allowing you to filter by category, days, location, host, etc. You can subscribe to certain filters so you are notified whenever an event in the category you're interested in is posted on a day or time slot you're subscribed to

                        Promotion of events on college campuses is currently strongly focused on clubs. We want to make hosting events on campus more accessible to everyone, and our app gives everyone the platform to organize and promote their events, no matter the size. Anyone is free to promote anything from book clubs to picnics to study sessions to just general hangouts to meet people.
