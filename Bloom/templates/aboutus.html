                    Bloom is an app designed to vitalize campus life by allowing everyone to easily host, find, promote, or keep track of groups and events on campus.

                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    Our platform makes this incredibly simple, by providing easy access to groups. Each group has a feed where you can see the latest posts, and if you want to keep track of certain groups more closely, you can join them and see posts from only those on your "Groups you follow" feed. Otherwise, you can just browse the "All posts" feed to see what's happening on campus regardless of group.

                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    Posting your event on Bloom allows it to reach a wider audience and makes it easier for the people interested in what you're hosting to keep track of upcoming events. If the group your event would be for isn't available, you may also just make it yourself by clicking the "Create a group" button and filling out the form.

                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    Promotion of events on college campuses is currently strongly focused on clubs. We want to make hosting events on campus more accessible to everyone, regardless of whether you have a club or not,and our app gives everyone the platform to easily organize and promote their events, no matter the size. Anyone is free to promote anything from book clubs to picnics to study sessions to just general hangouts to meet people and make friends.
